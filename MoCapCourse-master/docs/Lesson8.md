# 2. Convert Character to Oncyber Avatar

We can change the avatar by uploading .VRM files to Oncyber.

You can upload by following the steps:
- Find Settings in the lower right corner.
- Click Profile, there is a place to upload .VRM file.

However, the original file size of .VRM file is too large.

To reduce the file size, we can delete the vertex group of the .VRM file, and export it as .VRM file.
1. Open Blender, delete the objects.
