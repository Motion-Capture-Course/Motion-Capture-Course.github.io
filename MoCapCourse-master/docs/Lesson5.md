# 1 Introduction to Blender
Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation software that can be used for a variety of tasks such as modeling, animation, rendering, video editing, and more. Letâ€™s play with its controls first!
## 1.1 Open Blender
Open Blender and click any area within the red areas to activate a new project.

You will see a camera, a cube, and a light. We can call them **objects**. You can see that we are in the **Object Mode**. In this mode, we can select, create, move, and delete objects easily.

# 2. Essential Tools and Add-ons Setup
We will use add-ons to import files. An add-on is a piece of software that extends the functionality of Blender by adding new features or tools.
Here are the add-ons we will use:

**VRM Add-on for Blender** [Click Here to Download](https://vrm-addon-for-blender.info/releases/VRM_Addon_for_Blender-release.zip) \
This add-on use for importing and export VRM files

**Rokoko Studio Live for Blender** [Click Here to Download](https://github.com/Rokoko/rokoko-studio-live-blender/archive/master.zip) \
This add-on use for retargeting animations

**glTF 2.0 format**\
This is Blender Official add-on, no need to download.


## 2.1 Add-ons Installation
The downloaded addon files are zip files, but please do not unzip it, as the unzipped data will not function as an add-on.

1. Start Blender and select menu **Edit** --> **Preferences**.
