# Lesson 4: Introduction to Motion Capture
After this lesson, you will learn to create your own animated armature!
> - Motion Capture (mocap): a process of recording and analyzing the movement of objects or people by collecting data from special sensors. 
> - Armature: Bones that allow us to control the movements of a 3D character or object

Workflow：
1.	Find References (from online or make on your own)
2.	Register a Rokoko Studio Account
3.	Convert the video into an Armature

## 1. Find References (from online or make on your own)
To capture the motions, we first need a video with motions.

### Option 1: film your own reference video!

You can use webcam in Rokoko Studio website to film video!

Reminder: 
1.	Please make sure your background is as clean as possible! We suggest filming with a **white background**.
2.	Only **solo movement** can be detected. But you can process more than 1 video to animate more than 1 character!
3.	Fingers and faces cannot be detected. Please film references with large movements! We have an example of filming a video with a phone and doing motion capture. Here is the result:

4. We should capture the legs, otherwise it will look weird!
### Option 2: find reference videos online!
If you don't have much time to record a video, you can still find references from the internet.
e.g. dance covers, and action film cuts
